            LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
            politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since May
            7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
            Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New
            Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to
            hold the position in the city's history. Once in office, she
            established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
            creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city.
            Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
            finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to
            rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use,
            Cantrell has focused on her fairshare initiative to improve city
            infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green
            spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New
            Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and
            distributors. During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature,
            Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with Governor John Bel
            Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement
            secured $50 million in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure
            needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the
            city. Following the approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New
            Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Mayor Cantrell and the
            City Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters
            approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
            properties, as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission
            under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the
            presidents of Tulane, Loyola and Xavier universities and the
            University of New Orleans for her service to the community.

          The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are
          purple, green, and gold. The colors were first specified in
          proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
          inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in
          banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were
          chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely
          on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.

          Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex
          Organization, presented a theory that the colors were based on
          heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and
          Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their
          "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was
          already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided.
          Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that
          order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals
          (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and
          that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.

          Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple,
          green, and gold-colored floats themed around the concepts, the Rex
          organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that
          order symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are
          commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even
          though this order technically violates the rule of tincture.

          The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras, which can fall on any
          Tuesday between February 3 and March 9 (depending on the date of
          Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday). In New Orleans, the Zulu parade
          rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne
          and ending at Broad and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St.
          Charles following the traditional Uptown route from Napoleon to St.
          Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have
          hundreds of floats blowing loud horns, with entire families riding and
          throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons.
          Numerous smaller parades and walking clubs also parade around the
          city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish Channel
          Corner Club, Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all
          start early in the day Uptown and make their way to the French Quarter
          with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the
          Society of Saint Anne journeys from the Bywater through Marigny and
          the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice
          Tumblers rambles from bar to bar in Marigny and the French Quarter
          from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided into
          uptown and downtown tribes, parade in their finery.
